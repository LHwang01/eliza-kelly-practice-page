    <div class="flex">
        <p>Hello! My name is Eliza Kelly! I was born and grew up in Sheepshed Bay, Brooklyn but moved to Canada when I
            was 18. As a child, my dream was to be a painter, and I continued to pursue that dream as I grew up! I have
            been painting since I was 8 years old and professionally since I was 16. My
            favorite art style was (and continues to be) romanticism! I always had an interest and "romanticized" the
            characteristics of romantic art, such as nature, landscapes, and passionate emotions. In addition to this, I
            am also interested in the time period of romantic art, being the early 19th century. During my free time, I
            enjoy reading, vising cold places, indulging in photography, trying new food, and, of course, painting!</p>
